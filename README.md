**Abstract—** Automated license plate detection and recognition play a crucial role in the modern, high-speed environment. Identifying and
detecting many vehicles simultaneously in densely populated cities such as Dhaka, Bangladesh, poses a higher challenge that
requires more efficiency. This project proposed to increase the existing YoloV8 algorithm, which is currently considered the
most advanced by adding effective Bengali number plate detection. Also, we’d like to implement optical character recognition
to accurately recognize the contents of the number plates. Finally, we showcase the successful detection of number plates in a
video. We have attained 97.8% accuracy in detecting Bengali number plates. We curated a dataset of Bengali license plates
consisting of over 1080 annotated photos. Subsequently, we utilized the dataset to train YoloV8.
